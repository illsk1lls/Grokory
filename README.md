Grok Speech Recognition using the API via Powershell

To use your API create a system environment variable named GrokAPIKey with your key information
Example of how to add your API key with an Admin CMD prompt:

SETX GrokAPIKey 01010101010KeyDataHere0101010101010

Then close the console window and run Grokory.ps1, if no API key is found a canned response will be given.

Hold the left Ctrl key to speak to Grok, release the key and he will speak back to you. ;)
Initial version is console based, eventually this will be GUI based.
